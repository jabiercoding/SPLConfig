# SPLConfig
Software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that share a common set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment. A feature represents an increment in functionality relevant to some stakeholders. SPLs commonly use a feature model to capture and document common and varying features. The key challenge of using feature models is to derive a product configuration that satisfies all business and customer requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents a tool, called SPLConfig, to support business during product configuration in SPL. Based on feature models, SPLConfig automatically finds an optimal product configuration that maximizes the customer satisfaction.
